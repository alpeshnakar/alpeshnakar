          In today's digital landscape, the traditional perimeter-based security model is no longer sufficient. The concept of "trust but verify" has evolved into "never trust, always verify" - the core principle of Zero Trust.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Zero Trust?</h2>
        <p>
          Zero Trust is a security framework that requires all users, whether inside or outside the organization's network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before being granted access to applications and data. It operates on the assumption that a breach is inevitable and, therefore, a constant state of verification is necessary.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Principles of Zero Trust:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>**Verify Explicitly:** All access to resources must be verified based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, and more.</li>
          <li>**Use Least Privilege Access:** Users are only granted the minimum level of access they need to perform their duties.</li>
          <li>**Assume Breach:** Every request is viewed as a potential threat.</li>
        </ul>
